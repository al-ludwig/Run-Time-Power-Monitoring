# Vivado Projects

## PE_demo

In this project the power analysis tool in Vivado is used to estimate the switching activity of the inputs and ouputs of a vhdl-design.
The design consists of a vhdl-module, wich produces a pulse when a button is pressed (=high). 

To run Vivado and see the power report execute the **PE_demo.bat** file in the project directory.
